+ Removed duplicates for qual and AAqual for 2022 world championships, Liverpool.
I included VT1 pages into m/w_qual_VT.pdf files before dropping All-Around
qualification entries, so it won't lose any information.

+ Changed all RG into SR, by editing in combine.R file.

+ For Oceania Continental Championships 2023, change 'Australia' into 'AUS',
'New Zealand' into 'NZL'.

+ Modified date and comma for BIRMINGHAM 2022 Commonwealth Games. It was a typo.

+ Removed 10th from competition name of  2023 10th Senior European Championships,
so the competition name will align with that of 2022.

+ Changed incorrect (ASCII?) characters into -  in the dates of Baku and Cairo
World Cup. That ASCII was caused by using a 'dash' in the Chinese input method.

+ For 2022 51st FIG Artistic Gymnastics World Championships and 2023 Central
American and Caribbean Games, make the Competition name include the year.

+ Changed 'BRN' into 'GBR' for the 2023 and 2022 British championships.

+ Changed competition name 'FISH World University Games' into 'FISU World
University Games.
