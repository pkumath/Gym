## Predicting outcomes for a set of 5-person teams

In this part you will focus on predicting outcomes (scores, medals, probability of medaling, or other outcomes of interest) for a single set of 5-person teams for the countries in the competition.  

1. Determine a reasonable set of countries that will compete in the Olympics
2. Determine a reasonable 5-person team for every country. This does not have to be optimal at this point, just reasonable.  
3. Determine the additional gymnasts, not from one of the qualifying countries, that will qualify for the Olympics. Don't spend a lot of time on these first three points. Just get something reasonable that you can use in #4.
4. Assuming these are the 5-person teams, simulate, or otherwise determine the likely outcomes of 

    a. the qualifying stage, 
    b. team all-around, 
    c. individual all-around, and 
    d. individual event finals. 

Do this for men's and women's competitions. 

## Read the dataset from data_2022_2023.csv
  
```{r}
  # Read the dataset from data_2022_2023.csv
  data <- read.csv("data_2022_2023.csv")

  # Select the contry column from the data
  country <- data$Country
  # Select 12 contries from the data. Note that we should ignore repeated entries.
  country <- unique(country)
  country <- country[1:12]
  # Select the rows in the data that matches the contries we selected
  data <- data[data$Country %in% country]
