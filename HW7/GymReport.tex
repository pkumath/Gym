\section{Rules Reminder}
\subsection{Apparatus}
women(6): team all-around, individual all-around, vault, uneven bars, balance beam, and floor exercise
\\
men (8): team all-around, individual all-around, floor exercise, pommel horse, still rings, vault, parallel bars, and high bar

Specifically,

For women: (4 apparatus)

$\mathrm{BB}=$ Balanced Beam

$\mathrm{VT}=$ Vault

$\mathrm{FX}=$ Floor Exercise

$\mathrm{UB}=$ Uneven Bars

For men: (6 apparatus)

$\mathrm{VT}=$ Vault

$\mathrm{SR}=($ Still) Rings

$\mathrm{PH}=$ Pommel Horse

$\mathrm{PB}=$ Parallel Bars

$\mathrm{HB}=$ Horizontal Bars

$\mathrm{FX}=$ Floor Exercise

Note: VT indicates that only 1 vault was performed VT1 may indicate that only 1 vault was performed OR it could indicate the 1 st of 2 vaults that were performed

Phase & Rule \\
\hline
Team Composition & \begin{tabular}{l}
Each team consists of 5 athletes, but only 4 \\
compete on each apparatus during the qualify- \\
ing round. \\
\end{tabular} \\
\hline
Qualifying Round (4 up, 3 count) & \begin{tabular}{l}
4 out of the 5 athletes on each team compete \\
on each apparatus. The top 3 scores on each \\
apparatus are summed for team placement. \\
\end{tabular} \\
\hline
Team Finals (3 up, 3 count) & \begin{tabular}{l}
Top 8 teams from the qualifying round com- \\
pete. Scores are based on the "3 up, 3 count" \\
rule, meaning all 3 athletes' scores on each ap- \\
paratus count towards the team total. \\
\end{tabular} \\
\hline
Individual All-Around Finals & \begin{tabular}{l}
Athletes must compete on all apparatuses in \\
the qualifying round to be eligible. The top 24 \\
athletes qualify, with a max of 2 gymnasts per \\
country. \\
\end{tabular} \\
\hline
Apparatus Finals & \begin{tabular}{l}
The top 8 athletes on each apparatus from the \\
qualifying round advance, with a maximum of \\
2 gymnasts per country. \\
\end{tabular} \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}


\subsection{Note: Qualifying Round}
Individual Qualification: Countries that do not have a full team can qualify a maximum of 3 individual athletes per gender. These individual gymnasts are allowed to compete in the qualifying round to get into apparatus final.

Apparatus Participation: The individual gymnasts representing countries without a full team can participate on all apparatuses in the qualifying round. This allows them to be considered for both the individual all-around and apparatus finals.

\section*{Remark}
We would like to express that translating Python code to R code is indeed a challenging task. We sincerely apologize for the projects written in Python; however, we would like to mention that we have dedicated several days to translating them. We kindly request future students in this course to refrain from attempting this, as it will ultimately result in a significant waste of time.
